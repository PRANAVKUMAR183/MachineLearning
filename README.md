### [Project_1:RestaurantReviews](https://github.com/PRANAVKUMAR183/RestaurantReviews) (Link to project)

*This is a project I did during the course of my machine learning certification.

*This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews for restaurants and predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) using machine learning techniques

**Key Techniques Used**: Data Preprocessing,Bag of Words (BoW),Modeling,Prediction,Evaluation

**Outcome**:Model predicted the results with a 73% accuracy.


### [Project_2:Best_Advertisement](https://github.com/PRANAVKUMAR183/Best_Advertisement) (Link to project)

*This is a project I did during the course of my machine learning certification.

*The goal of this project is to determine the best advertisement to display by analyzing Click-Through Rates (CTR) using reinforcement learning.

**Key Techniques Used**: Data Preprocessing,Thompson Sampling,

**Outcome**:A histogram was plotted tovisualize the result and finalize the best add.
